# 🧠 When AI Forgot My Work: A Memory Continuity Protocol

## Overview

This repository introduces a user-led protocol to restore and preserve memory continuity across long-term GPT-4 projects. It is a response to memory breakdowns experienced by structured users working with complex, multi-project architectures.

> “We don’t just need smarter AI. We need committed collaborators — who don’t forget.”

## Contents
- `/docs` — Protocol overview, architecture diagram, and recovery philosophy
- `/protocol` — Placeholder scripts and logic for parsing `conversations.json` and rebuilding project summaries
- `README.md` — This file

## Goals
- Provide resilient workflows for creators who rely on AI memory
- Propose the idea of a “Protected User Memory Tier”
- Invite collaboration on tools for memory recovery and anchoring
